;Pill normal is for the establishing that we have what works, reference other paper, then modify, is the idea.

     Run for longer to see periods of oscillations and if they die out.
     -Test a 4.00 3.50 and maybe a 4.00 3.75
     -Test with very lopsided density see if settles down into same max intensity oscillations
     -Know how short is too short
     -Are the movies in the plots right now microscopy view or otherwise?  Important to know if going to compare densities of proteins close to walls.
          Look up distance that the aversion can take place over, so how far does cell have to be to "push away" other cells?  Then look at cell densities
          that distance from walls.
     -Look at a larger amount of density and see if settles down to different (more extreme difference) values.
     -The time map plots seem inconsistent in that some show the highest
densities on the poles, some in the centers, some on just one pole.
For these want to run starting from a time when the proteins are
evenly spread out (so between two maxima) and stop at a similar point
at the end.
   -The time map plots that I believe show the max density to be in the middle of the cell!  Show this definately and then play with plotting every time it goes above a certain density of protein, so maybe its the extreme nature of the oscillations that stop the polymer.

Look more at randst plots.  Investigate with both the interplay with the different protein plots.  Try to verify the qualitative story told in the other paper.

   -Start the randst so that density is max at the pole to start
   (the bottom), now its only on the side and that doesn't work as
   well
   -Start the star shape Randst 96 with density max only in one corner, now it starts with it on the side and so there's an equal max in the two poles on the right.

   -nflE has short burst maxima in the poles, mostly right along the walls.
   -Randst 97 with density max starting on the bottom of cell.  And then also with density max starting in the left little bump.

   -Want to run everything twice as long.

Official to do:
-Once you get data, time_map needs to be run with more selective beginning and ending
-Try time_map with cuttoff minimum densities

Run everything below for twice as long as we did before.
Run everything with both slices and microscopy
Add the Nde movies and plots.  We now plot everything else but these.

pill:
4.00 3.75
4.00 3.50
4.00 3.00
4.00 2.00
4.00 0.50
4.00 2.00 - Very lopsided density (like 500)
4.00 0.50 - Very lopsided density (like 500)

Weds Jul 24: I have re-run all of the simulations, but nflE and nflD are now NflE and NflD, and the subsequent plots show counts rather than densities. The individual nATP are either densities or counts depending on whether or not the first letter is capitalized. Working on running the slice data, then will be running randst. Since the program now sims for 10x as long, the box plots need to be re-run for just one period.


Randst:
96 - As before
96 - With density max starting in one corner
97 - As before
97 - With denisty max filling the little bump on the left
97 - With density max starting in bottom pole
98 - As before but run for three times as long
99 - As before


-with frequency, implement a print out that states the time and density of each maximum (top of peak) so that can see the exact period and then also can compare density maxima at different positions in the cell.  Want eventually to add a picture showing where your looking and compare the middle of cell maxima to edge.
-table with protein periods at different dimensions of pill cell.
-also on this table the protein density maxima comparison between the middle point and the end pill point
-make a table of the different cell dimenstions and there periods, so can compare the periods of the different pill dimensions
-time_map - put a cutoff at 1.1*(avg density) anything below doens't add to it, and see what looks like
-looking at the difference between our all slice plots for 15 and 500, something's wrong - the amounts of density are very different.
-somethings wrong with the last part of the normalized plots for frequency.  They look like they're getting cut off somehow (the line at the top is flat)

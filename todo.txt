;Pill normal is for the establishing that we have what works, reference other paper, then modify, is the idea.

     Run for longer to see periods of oscillations and if they die out.
     -Test a 4.00 3.50 and maybe a 4.00 3.75
     -Test with very lopsided density see if settles down into same max intensity oscillations
     -Know how short is too short
     -Are the movies in the plots right now microscopy view or otherwise?  Important to know if going to compare densities of proteins close to walls.
          Look up distance that the aversion can take place over, so how far does cell have to be to "push away" other cells?  Then look at cell densities
          that distance from walls.
     -Look at a larger amount of density and see if settles down to different (more extreme difference) values.
     -The time map plots seem inconsistent in that some show the highest
densities on the poles, some in the centers, some on just one pole.
For these want to run starting from a time when the proteins are
evenly spread out (so between two maxima) and stop at a similar pointe
at the end.
   -The time map plots that I believe show the max density to be in the middle of the cell!  Show this definately and then play with plotting every time it goes above a certain density of protein, so maybe its the extreme nature of the oscillations that stop the polymer.

Look more at ranst plots.  Investigate with both the interplay with the different protein plots.  Try to verify the qualitative story told in the other paper.

The referee had four corrections to suggest, which we address here.

1) In Abstract “…while the stochastic model, which is based on the
   same reaction-diffusion equations, predicts more spatially irregular
   oscillations.” This is vague formulation. Perhaps one could state that
   the oscillations decay over 5-10 periods.

The rate of temporal decay or irregularity (5-10 periods) is distinct
from the spatial irregularity.  Therefore we have left the abstract as
is.

2) Page 3 “This allows us to test the performance of this important
   model in more extreme situations than has been done previously,
   furthering our understanding of how and to what extent it breaks
   down.” Presumably the model does not break down but the solution
   becomes chaotic.

By "breaks down" we did not mean become chaotic, but rather fail to
agree with experimental observations.  To make this point more clear,
we have changed "it [the model] breaks down" to "its predictions
fail".

3) Page 2 line 46 extra “the”

We believe that the "the" was correct on that line, but the sentence
was made confusing by a citation in between the words "instantaneous"
and "the".  We have moved this citation to the end of the sentence to
make it more clear that the phrase "increase or make instantaneous"
applies to "the nucleotide exchange rate".

4) Everywhere E. coli should be written in italics.

We have made this change to italicize E. coli.

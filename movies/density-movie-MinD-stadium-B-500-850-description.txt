Movie that shows the evolution of MinD density over a 350 second
interval in the stadium B cell.  There is one frame for every half
second of simulation time. Above are results from the stochastic model
and below are results from the deterministic model.  The density shown
is integrated over the direction normal to the screen, so that the
data is shown in molecules/micron^2.

Movie that shows the evolution of MinD density over a 250 second
interval in a wild-type, pill-shaped cell.  There is one frame for
every half second of simulation time. Above are results from the
stochastic model and below are results from the deterministic model.
The density shown is integrated over the direction normal to the
screen, so that the data is shown in molecules/micron^2.
